# AoC Solutions Repository

Welcome to the **Advent of Code (AoC) Solutions** repository!  
This repo is for sharing your solutions in an organized and collaborative way.

## How to Upload Your Solution

1.  **Create a folder with your username**  
    Example:
        /john_doe

2.  **Inside your username folder, create a subfolder for the day of the question**  
    Use the format:
        /john_doe/day01
        /john_doe/day02
    (Replace `day01` with the actual day number.)

3.  **Add your solution file(s)**  
    You can use any programming language. Name your files clearly, e.g.:
        solution.py
        solution.java

4.  **Include a README in the day folder explaining your approach**  
    Example content for `README.md` inside `day01`:
        # Day 01 Solution
        ## Approach
        - Briefly explain your logic.
        - Mention any optimizations or interesting techniques.
